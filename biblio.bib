                   becoming a more and more useful and important
                   information resource for people. As a result, automatic
                   review mining and summarization has become a hot
                   research topic recently. Different from traditional
                   text summarization, review mining and summarization
                   aims at extracting the features on which the reviewers
                   express their opinions and determining whether the
                   opinions are positive or negative. In this paper, we
                   focus on a specific domain - movie review. A
                   multi-knowledge based approach is proposed, which
                   integrates WordNet, statistical analysis and movie
                   knowledge. The experimental results show the
                   effectiveness of the proposed approach in movie review
